# Pull Request: Mobile-Optimized Liquidity Curve Designer

## Summary

This PR implements a comprehensive mobile-optimized liquidity curve designer for issue #26, enabling users to create custom liquidity distributions with up to 7 positions through an intuitive touch-friendly interface.

## Features Implemented

### Core Components

1. **LiquidityCurveDesigner** (`src/components/liquidity/LiquidityCurveDesigner.tsx`)
   - Main component orchestrating the curve design experience
   - Supports up to 7 concurrent liquidity positions
   - Includes 4 preset templates (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive, Wide)
   - Real-time validation and warnings
   - Price impact calculations

2. **LiquidityPosition** (`src/components/liquidity/LiquidityPosition.tsx`)
   - Individual position editor with touch-optimized controls
   - Dual sliders for price range and allocation percentage
   - Visual range preview with color coding
   - Warnings for narrow/wide ranges and low allocations
   - Haptic feedback on all interactions

3. **CurveVisualization** (`src/components/liquidity/CurveVisualization.tsx`)
   - SVG-based real-time curve preview
   - Interactive hover tooltips showing liquidity at each price point
   - Position range overlays with transparency
   - Current price indicator
   - Grid lines for better readability

4. **Curve Utilities** (`src/components/liquidity/curveUtils.ts`)
   - Liquidity curve calculations
   - Price impact estimations
   - Position validation logic
   - Preset curve generation
   - Overlap detection

### Integration

- Updated `LiquidityStep.tsx` to include "Custom" curve option
- Extended `WizardData` type to support `liquidityPositions` array
- Seamless integration with existing advanced launch flow

### Mobile Optimizations

- Touch-friendly sliders with adequate hit targets (44px minimum)
- Haptic feedback using existing `HapticProvider`
- Responsive layout adapting to screen size
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Educational tooltips for complex concepts

### Test Coverage

- Comprehensive test suites for all components
- Test-driven development approach
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for user interactions
- Edge case handling

## Technical Details

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support with strict typing
- Proper interface definitions in `types.ts`
- No use of `any` types

### Performance
- Memoized calculations for curve points
- Efficient SVG rendering
- Debounced slider updates

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to "The Works" (advanced launch)
2. In the Liquidity Settings step, select "Custom" curve type
3. Test adding/removing positions
4. Try the preset templates
5. Verify touch interactions on mobile devices
6. Check validation warnings

## Screenshots/Demo

The component features:
- Real-time curve visualization
- Color-coded position ranges
- Interactive price impact preview
- Mobile-optimized controls

## Notes

- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintains the 92% test coverage target
- No external dependencies added
